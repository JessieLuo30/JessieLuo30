## About Me
Hi! My name is <b>Jessie Luo</b>, a junior majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.
<br><br>
I'm a creative problem solving enthusiast with a constantly growing curiosity. Always ready to start on new projects and learn new skills. Apart from hacking stuff, I like cooking, crochet, badminton, and fishing.
<br>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IOS development and wechat mini-programs
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on full stack web apps
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🌶️ Fun fact: I add chili sauce to every dish I cook
